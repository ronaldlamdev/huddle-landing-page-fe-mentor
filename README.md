This was a "junior" level project I created for Frontend Mentor to test my flex and responsive design skills.
This was also an opportunity to test my mobile-first approach since I find it easier and more natural for me to code in 
desktop first. 
This project was created using React and Tailwind CSS.

#Some things I learned:

-Coding in mobile first
-Using the CSS selector: :nth-child() to target a specific direct child in a parent component. In this project, I wanted to target
the 1st and 3rd main card components to reverse the order of the text and image in those containers using flex-row-reverse.
-How to horizontally center an absolute positioned element using mx-auto (margin-inline: auto), left:0, and right-0.
